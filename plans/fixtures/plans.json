The Workout will grow muscle whilst defining it and burning fatcells. As you will not be lifting more than your bodyweight you can do more repetitions and gain that cut physique. The Plan consists of 5 days of exercise which are designed to target different sections of the chest, arms and the core. The Plan consists of 3 days a week of exercises which are designed to target different sections of the chest, arms and the core.

The press up or push up exercise targets many other secondary muscles which weightlifting such as bench press will not.You will receive in depth videos and guides which will give you a new plan each week. This is constantly evolving s there are many calisthenics exercises you can do almost anywhere.",

This killer workout plan makes sure you not only get the weight and fat burning but so you also get a nice even workout of all the core ab muscles. The common mistake is doing one type of exercise repeteively as this will focus on only one set of muscles. The plan is designed to target the upper and lower abs, the obliques and serratus. The plan makes sure that you are not burning out one specific muslce group but a slow and steady icnrease in productitivty and muscle activation means you will feel much stronger and be left with a killer ab by the end.",
