This killer workout plan makes sure you not only get the weight and fat burning but so you also get a nice even workout of all the core ab muscles. The common mistake is doing one type of exercise repeteively as this will focus on only one set of muscles. The plan is designed to target the upper and lower abs, the obliques and serratus. The plan makes sure that you are not burning out one specific muslce group but a slow and steady icnrease in productitivty and muscle activation means you will feel much stronger and be left with a killer ab by the end.",

The calisthenics program means you do not need the traditional cardio equipment such as running machine or a bike. This requires body and limb strength and lots of core exercises. The key is to stress the muscles but not to a point where you burn out. The aim on the plan is to target the fat and not the muscles so we will be showing you exercises to maximise strength and weight-loss and ensuring you do not burn out those muscles.",
