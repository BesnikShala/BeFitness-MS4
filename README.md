## Design

### Colour Scheme

* The main colour scheme of my site is Black and Yellow with a white and elegant background. The idea is to keep the colours and desing minimalistic
to show off the content. The imagery is key to products as the user is ideally paying for a service or product without seeing it in person. The images
and text are the providers vital information. In order to make these components stick out I have chosen light colours.  

### Typography

* I have used google fonts for this project again and the main font I have chosen is 'Lato'. This is for the simplicity and readability of the font. It is very clear and easy to read especially when using letter spacing as the text sits very well when centered. The other font used is Sans Serif, however this is a fallback font just incase google fonts cannot load. Again Sans Serif is widely used and very simple and easy to read. As this is mainly a recipe app and want to be able to easily read the information being given. Lato is dervied from Sans Serif so even if the font should fail it's replacement is very similiar.

### Icons

* Font Awesome 5.13.1 - I chose to use Font Awesone Icons instead of the Materialise Icons due to there being much more range and options. They are also better to target and style. They are also responsive on all screensizes.

### Imagery

* The majority of the images for products have been sourced from existing E-commerce sites with full reference of each image. The main site images have been sourced form professional sites such as Pexels and unsplash. The images are able to be changed by the admin. Users have access to upload and image for their profile. The images as mentioned are key when going for a minimalistic style as the images take focal point and attract the users to either view products or read more about them. I have spent a great deal in finding the best images to display so that the site can be both enticing and visually attractive for new users and returning users. 

### Wireframes

* The wireframes were drawn using Balsamiq. They have differed from the actual rendering of the site. With great recommendations from my mentor I was able to implement design changes which slightly differ from the intial design.
